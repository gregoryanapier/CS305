# CS 305 Project Two – Secure Software Enhancement for Artemis Financial

This project involved refactoring and securing an existing Java-based web application for a fictional client, Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that specializes in creating individualized plans for savings, retirement, insurance, and investments. They requested enhancements to their current software to better protect client data by implementing secure communication protocols and data integrity checks.

To address these needs, I identified and mitigated software security vulnerabilities through static analysis and manual code review. I implemented a SHA-256 checksum feature to verify the integrity of data transfers and converted the application from HTTP to HTTPS by generating and applying a self-signed certificate. These actions were taken to ensure secure, encrypted communication between client and server. Secure coding practices were followed throughout, including proper exception handling, avoidance of insecure libraries, and use of Java’s built-in cryptographic tools. This work emphasizes the importance of software security in maintaining data privacy, regulatory compliance, and client trust.

One of the more helpful components of the project was the structured vulnerability assessment process flow diagram, which guided my review and helped prioritize areas such as cryptographic usage and secure error handling. A challenge was configuring the keystore and ensuring the certificate was correctly applied to enable HTTPS, but resolving it strengthened my understanding of SSL/TLS setup in Spring Boot applications.

To test functionality and verify security, I conducted manual runs of the refactored application and used OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for newly introduced vulnerabilities. These tools provided confirmation that the updates were safe and that the application ran as expected. In future projects, I would continue using static testing tools like Dependency-Check alongside secure design principles to evaluate risk and choose appropriate mitigation strategies.

Resources like Java Keytool, MessageDigest for hashing, Spring Boot SSL configuration, and dependency-check tools proved essential and will be helpful in future assignments or real-world development tasks. If asked to present this assignment to a potential employer, I would highlight my secure refactoring process, testing strategy, and ability to integrate encryption and HTTPS into an existing codebase. It demonstrates both practical development skills and an understanding of industry-standard software security practices.
